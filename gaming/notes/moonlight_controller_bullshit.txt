Fixing moonlight controller:

Go to the game page in steam.

Click "Edit controller settings".

Enable steam input (trust me).

Under "Quick settings by action set" select "Nothing".

This sets all buttons on the controller to do nothing.

If moonlight refuses to cooperate and defaults to "Default" manually set each button to do nothing.
